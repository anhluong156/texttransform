## Course Description:

As an increasing number of texts are digitized and made available for quantitative analysis of various kinds, algorithmic computation can be used to reveal patterns of affiliation and difference across them. Franco Moretti has argued that such opportunities have resulted in “a drastic loss of ‘measure’ . . . books are so human-sized; now that right size is gone.” What is the proper unit of the text in the digital age, if not the book? How do we understand texts that are “massively addressable at different levels of scale,” as Michael Witmore has suggested? And how do new levels of scale and “addressability” alter our understanding of literary history, not to mention our everyday practices of reading? 

In this course, we will consider how “macroscopic” approaches to text analysis change our existing notions of textuality, particularly as they revise 1990s discussions of hypertext within the field of textual studies. The course will include a mix of theoretical investigation and hands-on experimentation; as we explore quantitative approaches to literary analysis, we will seek to oscillate between close and distant reading practices. We will also look at how digital textuality is being expressed through various media forms and consider how recent interactive scholarly texts are changing publishing workflows in and outside of the academy. Readings will include works and projects by Wendy Chun, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, David Greetham, Matthew Jockers, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Jerome McGann, Tara McPherson, Franco Moretti, Steve Ramsay, Lisa Rhody, Mark Sample, Dennis Tenen, Ted Underwood, Michael Witmore, among others. Text analysis and visualization tools to be used will include DH Box, D3, Gephi, MALLET, NLTK, Python, R, Voyant, among others. Workshop attendance will be required.
